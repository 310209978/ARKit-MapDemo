Persistence gives your app a way to save the current augmented reality view so the user can load it and view it again. This can be handy if an augmented reality session can take place over an extended period of time, such as an augmented reality game where users can save the game and return to it at another time.</br>

Saving a world map in the user defaults is the simplest way to store an augmented reality view. The key is simply giving the user the ability to save a world map, load it at a later time, and clear the augmented reality view.
